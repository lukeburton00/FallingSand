# Falling Sand

This project is currently a simple prototype of a falling sand game, with plans to extend the simulation to include features such as a larger collection of element types, support for rigidbodies, and character control.


Most of the present features are either work-in-progress or placeholder, and as such will be improved upon or replaced in the future.


You can run the project for yourself as long as you have SDL2 installed where CMake can find it. Simply follow these steps:
- Clone the project
- Make a 'build' directory inside the cloned repository
- run 'cmake ..' with any desired flags
- run 'cmake --build .'
- finally, run the generated executable.
